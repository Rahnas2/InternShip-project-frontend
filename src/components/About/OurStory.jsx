                        MentorHub was born from a simple observation: there's a significant gap between what students learn in college and what the industry expects. Founded in 2023 by a team of educators and industry professionals, we set out to bridge this gap through personalized mentorship and practical skill development.

                        Our journey began when we noticed that despite having strong academic foundations, many final-year students struggled to secure meaningful internships and job opportunities. We realized that what was missing was not just technical knowledge, but industry insights, practical experience, and professional guidance.

                        Today, MentorHub has grown into a comprehensive platform that connects students with experienced professionals, providing them with the tools, knowledge, and confidence they need to succeed in their chosen careers.
